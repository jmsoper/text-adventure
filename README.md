Tiny text adventure in c++

To start up the game, make sure you're at the root of this directory and run `./basicGame`.

### tiny goals:
- [x] how does one include other files?
- [ ] how do I convert the user input to lowercase to make checks simpler
- [ ] how do I check for a word's presence in a string?
